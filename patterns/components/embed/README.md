# Radio Group

A radio group, `role="radiogroup"`, contains a list of radio button elements, `input[type="radio"]`, of which only one can be selected as the selected answer.

## Available Classes

Styling can be applied in the following ways:

* `.base--radiogroup` - class on each radio button
* `.base--STYLED radio` - `<radio>` tag inside of a form with class of `.base--STYLED`
* `%base--radio` - extended through Sass
